# Tjuka 2022: Body-Object Colexifications

This repository contains data and analyses used for a study of body-object colexifications, for example, ARM-BRANCH, HEAD-ROOF, in various languages. The colexifications were automatically computed for more than 2000 language varieties based on the _ClicsCore_ subset of [Lexibank](https://github.com/lexibank). The concepts included in the study were based on a concept list by Tjuka ([2022](https://calc.hypotheses.org/3840)). The 784 concepts in the list were divided into two groups: 134 body and 650 object concepts. The list was published on Zenodo and is available here: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6365495](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6365495).
